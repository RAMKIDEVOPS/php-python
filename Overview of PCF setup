Database setup with app 
-----------------------
1. Create a manifest.yml with services defined with app-name
2. Run Database service as User defined Service (cf cups command)
3. Check the User provisioned service with command cf services
4. Bind the Database information in the application by renedering "VCAP_SERVICES" which is environment varianble. This will eliminate hardcoding of credentials
How to make an app run in PCF ?
-------------------------------
1. Create a manifest.yml with buildpack supporting the application stack. In this case of sample app, we have PHP and Python. So we have to provide both PHP and Python buildpacks in manifest.yml
Since PHP buildpack executed python 2 and python buildpack relies on python 3, there would be a conflict to run both buildpacks in PCF. So better to run PHP and Python buildpacks as separate droplets and connect the application with API
So we would be using 2 manifest files. 1 for PHP and 1 for Python. 2 droplets with 2 CF pushes.
